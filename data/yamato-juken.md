### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Choose mid-range Enerage N/S model** (¥65-75万) instead of premium G3+/LEGANTIA
2. **Skip YUCACO** (save ¥1-2.5M) if not essential
3. **Standard specifications** rather than premium upgrades
4. **Defer rooftop garden** to Phase 2 (structural prep only initially)
5. **Enerage SGR** if budget is primary concern (¥40-55万 = significant savings)

---

### Budget Recommendation

**Optimal Strategy for ¥25-35M Budget:**

**If Land Already Owned:**
- **Target:** Enerage N, S, or L models (¥65-75万/tsubo)
- **30 Tsubo Building:** ¥19.5-22.5M
- **Exterior/Utilities:** ¥4-6M
- **Contingency:** ¥2-4M
- **Total:** ¥25.5-32.5M ✅ Fits comfortably

**If Purchasing Land:**
- **Target:** Enerage SGR or HV-ZERO+ (¥40-65万/tsubo)
- **30 Tsubo Building:** ¥12-19.5M
- **Land:** ¥8-12M
- **Exterior/Utilities:** ¥3-5M
- **Total:** ¥23-36.5M ⚠️ Tight but feasible

**Conclusion:** Yamato Juken has products that fit your ¥25-35M budget, especially if land is already secured or if choosing mid-range models. Premium models require upper budget range or land already owned.

   - **Rooftop Gardens:** What is included in rooftop garden package? Structural only or full garden installation?
   - **YUCACO:** Is YUCACO required for Grade 7 models or optional? Operating cost estimates?
   - **Ground Source Heat Pump:** Can GSHP be integrated instead of YUCACO? Technical feasibility?
   - **Internal Courtyard:** Portfolio examples of 坪庭 designs? Additional cost for courtyard integration?
   - **Natural Light:** How do you optimize passive solar and natural light in floor planning?
   - **Budget:** Detailed cost breakdown for 30 tsubo Enerage N with solar + rooftop garden?

4. **Portfolio Deep Dive**

   - Identify 3-5 projects matching aesthetic preferences
   - Note rooftop garden examples for discussion
   - Screenshot atrium/courtyard designs of interest

---

### Decision Framework

**Yamato Juken should be TOP CHOICE if:**
- ✅ Energy efficiency Grade 7 is absolute priority
- ✅ Rooftop garden concept highly appeals
- ✅ Urban/suburban lot with space constraints
- ✅ ZEH certification and proven track record essential
- ✅ 60-year warranty provides valuable peace of mind
- ✅ Contemporary modern aesthetic preferred
- ✅ National company stability important
- ✅ Budget allows ¥65-90万/tsubo range

**Consider as STRONG ALTERNATIVE if:**
- ⚠️ Energy performance top-tier but natural light also critical (compare with 仁科建設)
- ⚠️ Budget ¥25-35M total and land purchase needed (may require Enerage SGR/HV models)
- ⚠️ Personalized service highly valued (smaller 工務店 may provide more attention)
- ⚠️ Traditional ground garden strongly preferred over rooftop alternative

**Look at OTHER BUILDERS if:**
- ❌ Natural light/passive solar is #1 priority (仁科建設 "Sun and Wood" better fit)
- ❌ Traditional craftsmanship and natural materials core values (助川工務店, 石井工業)
- ❌ Require 10 houses/year ultra-personalized service (仁科建設, 水戸工務店)
- ❌ Budget under ¥60万/tsubo firm maximum
- ❌ Ground source heat pump non-negotiable and unverified compatibility concern

---

### Recommended Consultation Sequence

**Phase 1: Information Gathering (Weeks 1-2)**
1. Visit Yamato Juken Kashiwa showroom

**Phase 3: Final Decision (Week 5-6)**
1. Compare total value propositions
2. Negotiate final pricing and timeline
3. Verify all requirements compatibility
4. Select builder and begin design phase
