## The "Sun and Wood" Philosophy (太陽と木の家)

### Company Name Symbolism

**太陽 (Sun/Solar)** + **木 (Wood/Tree)** = Core Design Principles

The company name itself embodies the dual priorities that guide every design:

#### 太陽 (Sun) - Natural Light Optimization

**Passive Solar Design Expertise:**
- Strategic building orientation for maximum southern exposure
- Window placement optimization for light penetration throughout day
- Seasonal sun angle calculations for year-round benefit
- Daylighting strategies minimizing artificial lighting needs
- Interior spatial planning for light flow throughout home

**Philosophy:**
Natural light is not merely aesthetic—it impacts health, mood, energy costs, and quality of life. Every design decision considers: "How does this affect natural light?"

**Evidence in Portfolio:**
- Open floor plans without corridors allow light to reach interior spaces
- High ceilings and clerestory windows bring light deep into homes
- Barrier-free designs eliminate walls that block light transmission
- Strategic skylight placement for interior illumination

---

#### 木 (Wood) - Natural Materials & Sustainability

**Solid Wood Commitment (無垢材):**
- Domestic Japanese timber from strength-tested sources (Hida Takayama)
- Local Chiba Prefecture wood supporting regional forestry
- Natural, untreated materials emphasizing wood's inherent properties
- Beautiful aging rather than artificial finishes

**Philosophy:**
Wood is not just a building material—it's a living element that breathes, regulates humidity, provides natural insulation, and creates healthy indoor environments.

**Construction Approach:**
- **真壁 (Exposed Beam) Construction** - Structural wood left visible with pride
- Wood's natural humidity regulation maximized through exposure
- Thermal mass and insulation properties of wood fully utilized
- Beautiful grain and texture as interior design feature

---

### Integration: Sun + Wood = Optimal Living Environment

**Synergy:**
- Natural light illuminates beautiful wood grain throughout the day
- Wood's warmth contrasts with brightness of sunlight
- Passive solar heating absorbed by wood thermal mass
- Natural materials create healthy, comfortable, light-filled spaces

**Result:** Homes that feel alive, connected to nature, energy-efficient through passive design, and beautiful through simplicity rather than ornamentation.

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Start with Semi-Order System** (KAJIRAKU/HIRAYA/HOBBY)
   - Provides structure while allowing key customizations
   - More affordable than full custom
   - Still gets presidential attention and quality

2. **Prioritize Natural Light Features**
   - Internal courtyard (坪庭) - core to philosophy, not expensive "add-on"
   - Skylights - strategic placement vs. quantity
   - Window sizing/placement - design optimization (free) vs. premium glazing (costly)

3. **Phase Optional Features**
   - Solar panels: Defer to Phase 2 (structural prep in Phase 1)
   - Premium kitchen/bath: Start standard, upgrade later
   - Deck/exterior: Complete in phases as budget allows

4. **Leverage Natural Materials Standard**
   - Solid wood, plaster, diatomaceous earth included
   - No need to "upgrade" to natural materials (already standard)
   - Exposed beam aesthetic included (not premium add-on)

5. **Maximize Passive Design Value**
   - President's architectural expertise optimizes free passive solar gains
   - Natural light optimization reduces artificial lighting costs
   - Strategic design more valuable than expensive systems

### Budget Recommendation

**Optimal Strategy for ¥25-35M:**

**If Land Already Owned:**
- **Target:** Semi-Order System (HIRAYA for natural light + garden) or Full Custom
- **Building Budget:** ¥22-28M (allows for 35-40 tsubo custom)
- **Key Features:** Internal courtyard, strategic skylights, solar prep
- **Reserve:** ¥2-4M for contingency and Phase 2 (solar, landscaping)
- **Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect fit** - Can achieve all priorities

**If Purchasing Land:**
- **Target:** 規格住宅 (Spec Home) with key customizations
- **Land Budget:** ¥8-10M maximum
- **Building Budget:** ¥18-22M (semi-order system)
- **Focus customization on:** Natural light features (courtyard, skylights)
- **Defer:** Solar panels, premium finishes
- **Verdict:** ✅ **Achievable** - Prioritize light optimization, phase other features

### Decision Framework

**Nishina Kensetsu should be TOP CHOICE if:**
- ✅ Natural light is absolute #1 priority (core philosophy alignment)
- ✅ Internal courtyard (坪庭) strongly desired (ideal specialty)
- ✅ Ultra-personalized service valued (10 houses/year model appeals)
- ✅ Traditional craftsmanship + modern performance appreciated
- ✅ Natural materials important (solid wood, plaster, diatomaceous earth)
- ✅ Architect-led design process preferred over catalog selection
- ✅ Willing to wait if necessary for right builder (scheduling flexibility)
- ✅ Budget ¥25-35M with land owned or ¥20-28M building only
- ✅ Local Chiba builder supporting regional materials important

**Consider as STRONG ALTERNATIVE if:**
- ⚠️ Rooftop garden appeals more than traditional garden (Yamato Juken specialty)
- ⚠️ Maximum energy efficiency (Grade 7, UA 0.22) trumps personalized service
- ⚠️ Need immediate availability (cannot wait for limited production)
- ⚠️ Prefer national company stability and extensive portfolio review
- ⚠️ Want proven GSHP experience (capability unverified)

**Look at OTHER BUILDERS if:**
- ❌ Budget under ¥50万/tsubo firm requirement
- ❌ Natural light nice-to-have but not critical (wasting their specialty)
- ❌ Prefer technology/systems focus over craftsmanship (Yamato YUCACO, smart home)
- ❌ Need large company with multiple staff (single point of failure concern)
- ❌ Want extensive showroom experience before committing
- ❌ Cannot wait—need immediate construction start
- ❌ Prefer hands-off process with minimal client involvement
