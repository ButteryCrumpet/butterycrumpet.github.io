# CLAUDE Context for Japanese House Building Project

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive research project for building a custom home in Japan. The user (Simon) is planning to build a house in the Nagareyama/Kashiwa area of Chiba Prefecture and needs detailed information about builders, architects, processes, and costs.

## User Background

- **Location:** Planning to build in Nagareyama or Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan
- **Target Areas:** Along Tsukuba Express Line (Kashiwa Tanaka, Kashiwa no Ha Campus, Ootaka no Mori area)
- **Distance from Station:** Preferred <15 mins walking, max 25 mins
- **Experience:** Has lived in Japan for over a decade, married to Japanese national, near-fluent Japanese ability
- **Project Status:** Early research phase, gathering information to find best builder option

## Project Tenets (Core Values)

1. **Natural Light** - Maximizing natural illumination throughout the home
2. **Garden Space** - Strong emphasis on outdoor living and garden integration  
3. **Environmentally Friendly** - Sustainable materials and practices
4. **Energy Efficient** - High-performance systems and insulation

## Requirements

### Hard Requirements (Must-Have)
- **Garden Space** - Outdoor living area
- **Large Bath** - Spacious bathroom facilities
- **Minimum 3-4 LDK** - At least 3-4 bedroom equivalent layout

### Medium Requirements (Highly Desired)
- **Solar** - Solar power system
- **Ground Source Heat Pump** - Geothermal heating/cooling (air hybrid acceptable)
- **At least 1 additional non-LDK ground floor room** - For home gym use
- **Internal courtyard/garden/patio** - 坪庭 style inner garden space

### Soft Requirements (Nice to Have)
- **Skylights** - Natural light from above
- **Pantry** - Kitchen storage space

## Research Completed

### Documents Created
- `data/goals.md` - Original project goals and requirements
- `research-process.md` - Documentation of research methodology  
- `data/japan-house-building-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide to Japanese house building
- `data/builder-evaluation-list.md` - Evaluation of 13 major builders/architects
- `data/clehome.md` - Detailed profile of local builder CLEHOME
- `data/sumitomo-forestry.md` - Comprehensive analysis of Sumitomo Forestry product lineup

### Key Findings

#### Top Recommended Builders
1. **住友林業 (Sumitomo Forestry)** - GRAND LIFE series recommended
   - Excellent natural light/garden expertise through "living harmoniously with nature" philosophy
   - Single-story GRAND LIFE perfect for all requirements
   - Budget: ¥27-33M for 30 tsubo base

2. **CLEHOME** - Local Nagareyama builder
   - Perfect location match (based in target area)
   - Natural materials focus, cost-effective
   - Budget: Mid-range pricing (requires direct inquiry for specifics)

3. **デ・ステイル建築研究所** - Chiba-based architect
   - Nature integration specialty, full customization
   - Higher cost but maximum flexibility

#### Market Context
- **Regional pricing (Kashiwa/Nagareyama):** ¥35-45M typical for land + construction
- **Station proximity impact:** <10 min walk = ¥45M+, >30 min = ¥35-40M
- **工務店 vs ハウスメーカー:** Local builders typically 70% cost of major house makers

### Builder Types Understanding
- **ハウスメーカー (House Makers):** National companies, standardized products, higher cost, reliable
- **工務店 (Local Builders):** Regional companies, more customizable, cost-effective, variable quality  
- **設計事務所 (Architects):** Full custom design, highest flexibility, premium cost + 10-20% design fees

## Technical Research Areas

### Building Standards (Current)
- **2025 April:** Energy efficiency standards mandatory (Grade 4 minimum)
- **2030 Target:** ZEH standard (Grade 5) for all new homes
- **ZEH Requirements:** High insulation + renewable energy for net-zero energy
- **Seismic Standards:** Grade 3 recommended for insurance benefits

### Key Terminology
- **坪 (Tsubo):** 3.3㎡ unit for measuring house size and pricing
- **坪単価 (Tsubo-tanka):** Price per tsubo, key pricing metric
- **ZEH:** Net Zero Energy House standard
- **坪庭 (Tsubo-niwa):** Small internal courtyard garden
- **LDK:** Living-Dining-Kitchen layout designation

## Priority Questions for Further Research

1. **Ground Source Heat Pump Availability:** Which builders have GSHP experience?
2. **Internal Courtyard Examples:** Portfolio of 坪庭 implementations
3. **Specific Budget Ranges:** Actual project costs from preferred builders
4. **Timeline Expectations:** Design to completion duration
5. **Chiba Service Areas:** Confirm local availability and teams

## Research Approach Notes

- **Language Strategy:** Conducted searches in both English and Japanese for comprehensive coverage
- **Source Verification:** Cross-referenced multiple sources for pricing and technical information
- **Practical Focus:** Emphasized actionable information for decision-making rather than theoretical knowledge
- **Local Context:** Prioritized information specific to Chiba Prefecture and target areas

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Direct Contact Phase:** Schedule consultations with top 3 builders
2. **Model Home Visits:** Tour examples in target area
3. **Portfolio Reviews:** Request detailed project examples with budgets  
4. **Technical Verification:** Confirm GSHP and specialized system capabilities
5. **Timeline Planning:** Understand realistic project schedules

## Important Context for AI Assistants

- **User is experienced with Japan:** No need to explain basic Japanese concepts
- **Focus on practical details:** Emphasize actionable information over general advice
- **Budget consciousness:** While quality is important, cost-effectiveness matters
- **Environmental priorities:** Natural materials and sustainability are core values
- **Location specificity:** Chiba Prefecture focus is critical for relevance

This project represents early-stage research transitioning toward active builder engagement and decision-making.
